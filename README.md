# ASCII-Art-generator (GUI)
I've made a new version of my program for the people who want to use a GUI instead of the terminal.

You'll need to install the following packages :
- Pillow
- easygui
- python-resize-image
- Tkinter

At the line 23 you'll also need to replace 'kwrite' by your current text editor (e.g notepad)
